Introducing Combat Mode – an AddOn designed to bring a more dynamic action combat experience to World of Warcraft by implementing Free Look, Reticle Targeting, casting with mouse clicks, and more!

With a full suite of carefully programmed changes aimed at breathing some much-needed life into WoW's tab-targeting combat, Combat Mode introduces features like Free Look, allowing you to change your character’s facing direction by moving the mouse without needing to perpetually hold right-click. When enabled - either through a toggle or press & hold key bind - the cursor is locked to the center of the screen and transformed into a reticle capable of target selection, even supporting the use of @cursor or @mouseover macros.

Combat Mode takes it further by allowing you to cast spells with mouse clicks, a mechanic inspired by third-person action games. For convenience, the AddOn will automatically deactivate Free Look while interacting with a range of interface panels, reactivating it once closed. Additionally, you can expand this list of panels.

Experience World of Warcraft like never before with Combat Mode!

- [Free Look](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_look) - Rotate the player character's view with the camera without having to perpetually hold right click.
- Reticle Targeting - Enable users to target units by simply aiming the reticle at them, as well as allowing proper use of @mouseover and @cursor macro decorators in combination with the crosshairs.
- Optional adjustable dynamic Crosshair marker to assist with Reticle Targeting.
- Mouse Click Casting - When Free Look is enabled, frees your mouse clicks so you can cast up to 8 skills with them.
- Cursor Unlock - Automatically releases the cursor when opening interface panels like bags, map, character panel, etc.
